# Lystaria XO

Lystaria is a custom Obsidian theme created specifically for my blogging vault.

After trying (and uninstalling) countless existing themes, I realized none of them supported the way I actually write. This vault holds every draft of every blog I’ve published on my self-hosted site, and I needed a space that felt comfortable, clear, and enjoyable to work in for long stretches of time.

What started as a practical solution slowly became something lighter, softer, and more fun than I originally planned — and Lystaria grew out of that process.

## Why This Theme Exists

Lystaria was built to support:

- Drafting long-form blog posts without visual fatigue  
- Switching between writing and reading mode without layout clashes  
- A calm, visually gentle environment that doesn’t feel sterile or heavy  
- A creative space that feels *inviting*, not utilitarian  

This theme prioritizes **writing comfort first**, with reading mode polished as a finished presentation layer.

## Design Philosophy

- **Built for writing, not just viewing**  
  Editor mode spacing, line height, and visual rhythm are intentionally tuned for drafting.

- **Reading mode is composed and clean**  
  Finished notes should feel structured and readable without feeling cramped.

- **Soft accents instead of harsh lines**  
  Gradients, rounded elements, and subtle highlights replace sharp borders.

- **Desktop and mobile both matter**  
  Mobile-specific adjustments are included where Obsidian renders differently.

## Features

- Soft dark color palette designed for long writing sessions

## Tags

Tags are styled as small, readable chips:

- **Editor mode:** optimized for clarity and alignment while typing  
- **Reading mode:** rendered as solid, unified elements  

Mobile rendering is handled separately to ensure consistency across platforms.
